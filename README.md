## 📝 Description

This project replicates the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game, where two players take turns to place their mark (O or X) on a 3x3 grid. The game determines the winner based on traditional rules:
- A player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their mark.
- If the grid is filled and no one wins, the game results in a draw.
